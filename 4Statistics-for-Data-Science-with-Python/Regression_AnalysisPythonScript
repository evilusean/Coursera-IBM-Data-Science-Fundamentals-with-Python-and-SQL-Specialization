"""Regression with T-test: Using the teachers rating data set, does gender affect teaching evaluation rates?
Initially, we had used the t-test to test if there was a statistical difference in evaluations for males and females, we are now going to use regression. We will state the null hypothesis:

 = 0 (Gender has no effect on teaching evaluation scores)
 is not equal to 0 (Gender has an effect on teaching evaluation scores)
We will use the female variable. female = 1 and male = 0

#Conclusion: Like the t-test, the p-value is less than the alpha (α) level = 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis as there is evidence that there is a difference in mean evaluation scores based on gender. The coefficient -0.1680 means that females get 0.168 scores less than men.

Regression with ANOVA: Using the teachers' rating data set, does beauty score for instructors differ by age?
State the Hypothesis:

µµµ (the three population means are equal)
 At least one of the means differ
Then we group the data like we did with ANOVA

#p-value is greater than 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis as there is no evidence that the mean difference of tenured and untenured instructors are different

#Question 2: Using the teachers' rating data set, does being an English speaker affect the number of students assigned to professors?¶
#Use "allstudents"

## add an intercept (beta_0) to our model

# Print out the statistics

#At α = 0.05, p-value is greater, we fail to reject the null hypothesis as there is no evidence that being a native English speaker or a non-native English speaker affects the number of students assigned to an instructor.
#At α = 0.1, p-value is less, we reject the null hypothesis as there is evidence that there is a significant difference of mean number of students assigned to native English speakers vs non-native English speakers.

#Question 3: Using the teachers' rating data set, what is the correlation between the number of students who participated in the evaluation survey and evaluation scores?
#Use "students" variable

#R-square is 0.001, R will be √0.001, correlation coefficient is 0.03 (close to 0). There is a very weak correlation between the number of students who participated in the evaluation survey and evaluation scores
