T-Test: Using the teachers' rating data set, does gender affect teaching evaluation rates?
We will be using the t-test for independent samples. For the independent t-test, the following assumptions must be met.

One independent, categorical variable with two levels or group
One dependent continuous variable
Independence of the observations. Each subject should belong to only one group. There is no relationship between the observations in each group.
The dependent variable must follow a normal distribution
Assumption of homogeneity of variance
State the hypothesis

¬µ¬µ ("there is no difference in evaluation scores between male and females")
¬µ¬µ ("there is a difference in evaluation scores between male and females")

ANOVA: Using the teachers' rating data set, does beauty score for instructors differ by age?
First, we group the data into cateries as the one-way ANOVA can't work with continuous variable - using the example from the video, we will create a new column for this newly assigned group our categories will be teachers that are:

40 years and younger
between 40 and 57 years
57 years and older
